<p><a href="https://github.com/zacklofgren/bible-web">bible-web</a> is now a thing.
I forked <a href="https://github.com/bontibon/kjv">kjv</a> to make it. kjv is a cool
set of scripts that takes a tab separated value file (tsv) and formats it for your pager.
I wrote a couple of ugly scripts to generate a tsv for a World English Bible (WEB)
version of kjv. Thus, bible-web. It's not called "web" purely because web is
ambiguous. For starters, it's the name of the GNOME desktop
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web/">web browser</a>. I wanted it to be clear
what program you were using when you launched bible-web. This program would not have
been possible without the components being copyfree.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="http://copyfree.org/standard">Copyfree
Standard Definition here</a>. I won't be posting the whole thing. In essence if
something is copyfree, it means you can use, modify, redistribute, etc. without
restriction. Most copyfree licenses just state that you must attribute the
original author/developer and that there's no warranty when using the work.
This seems pretty great right? The fact that kjv and the World English Bible
translation are copyfree (specifically, public domain) meant that I could use,
modify, and redistribute them however I wanted. This benefits you, the reader,
because now you can read the WEB in your terminal with bible-web.</p>

<p>kjv and WEB being copyfree was a requirement for bible-web to exist in its
current form. Initially, I tried to create a fork of kjv with the English Standard
Version of the Bible, one of my preferred translations. However, due to the Terms
and Conditions of their API, I could not download a whole copy of the ESV. I considered 
creating a script that did this against their conditions since it was for personal use
and I wouldn't redistribute it. However, I decided against it.
<a href="https://mcmackins.org">Someone</a> suggested I just use WEB,
so that it would be easier to implement and that I could redistribute it.</p>

<p>Copyfree wasn't just useful for letting me use and redistribute the works in
general. It also ensured that I was able to combine the works. Some free licenses,
like the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPL</a> and the
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA 3.0</a> are great
in that they make it so you can redistribute and modify the works. However, they
restrict how you can do so. Both of these licenses stipulate that any derivatives
of the work must also be licensed under the same terms. This would mean if kjv
was licensed under the GPL (typically used for software) and WEB was licensed
under the CC BY-SA 3.0 (typically used for written works and other art), then
combining them in bible-web wouldn't be legal. Even though the licenses have the
same goals of allowing people to modify and redistribute the works in much of
the same ways to encourage the development of free works, they are incompatible
with each other. As a result, they actually discourage the development of free works. If
I couldn't find a copyfree bible reader and translation, I probably wouldn't have bothered
making bible-web. If either of kjv or WEB were copyleft (assuming they used GPL or
or CC BY-SA 3.0, the most popular licenses for each medium respectively), then it
would've been illegal to include them together as the GPL is only for software 
and CC is more for art since it doesn't specify what to do with source code.</p>

<p>Copyfree licenses on the other hand let you do this. Any of the
<a href="http://copyfree.org/standard/licenses">copyfree certified</a> licenses
allow anyone to use the works however they see fit. Since I had the freedom to
combine kjv and WEB into a new work, I could create bible-web. I have given also
you that same freedom by releasing bible-web under the
<a href="http://coil.apotheon.org/about/">Tesla Copyfree Open Innovation License</a>
or COIL. This means you have the same freedoms to with bible-web that I had when
creating it. This includes relicensing it if needed to be able to be combined with
another work.</p>

<p>Copyfree is how we can make this world better. Copyleft, in its aim to promote
free culture, actually restricts it due to its strict licensing conditions for
derivatives. Copyright just restricts. It doesn't help anyone contribute to culture.
I encourage you to license your work under a copyfree license, preferably COIL, so
that anyone will have complete freedom when using your work. Maybe, they'll
create something cool that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.</p>

<p><b>Disclaimer</b>: I don't think bible-web is really that amazing.
I only wrote some scripts to take the text files WEB distributes and format them
as a tsv file. It's just a great example of how copyfree is necessary. Also, I believe
having free access to the Bible is important, and bible-web helps with that.</p>

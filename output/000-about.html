<p>My name is Zack Lofgren.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Jesus, <a href="http://copyfree.org">copyfree</a>
software developer, and sysadmin.
</p>
<p>I believe Jesus Christ is "the way, and the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).
I believe through sin every person has separated themselves from God.
Through Jesus' blameless sacrifice on the cross, we are redeemed to the Father.
There is no other way to God. Jesus is my Lord and Savior. It is through
relationship with Him that I have true life.
</p>
<p>For programming, I am most comfortable with C, Python, and Java, but I also
have experience with C++ and php. I am close to finishing my degree in Computer
Science from Colorado State University.
</p>
<p>For sysadmin, I am very familiar with Linux-based operating systems.
I am also becoming more familiar with OpenBSD since my switch to that from Linux.
I am also pretty familiar with Windows and macOS, though not as much as Linux.
I currently work for a Managed Services Provider at one client providing help
desk and sysadmin services in a Windows environment.
</p>
<p>I also feel like <a href="https://suckless.org">suckless</a> is a good
philosophy for software. I think it's sometimes unavoidable to have a solution
not suck, but when possible, suckless is the preferred solution.</p>
